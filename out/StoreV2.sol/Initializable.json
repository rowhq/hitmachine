Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect. The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \\\"step\\\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized. For example: [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding] ```solidity contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {     function initialize() initializer public {         __ERC20_init(\\\"MyToken\\\", \\\"MTK\\\");     } } contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {         __ERC20Permit_init(\\\"MyToken\\\");     } } ``` TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}. CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity. [CAUTION] ==== Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized. An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed: [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding] ```\",\"errors\":{\"InvalidInitialization()\":[{\"details\":\"The contract is already initialized.\"}],\"NotInitializing()\":[{\"details\":\"The contract is not initializing.\"}]},\"events\":{\"Initialized(uint64)\":{\"details\":\"Triggered when the contract has been initialized or reinitialized.\"}},\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"flattened/StoreV2.sol\":\"Initializable\"},\"evmVersion\":\"cancun\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[\":@openzeppelin-upgradeable/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/\",\":@openzeppelin/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/\",\":erc4626-tests/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/lib/erc4626-tests/\",\":forge-std/=lib/forge-std/src/\",\":halmos-cheatcodes/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/lib/halmos-cheatcodes/src/\",\":openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/\",\":openzeppelin-contracts/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/\"]},\"sources\":{\"flattened/StoreV2.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xeceb79370488cccbaec3668f4079362271f4c20d957e08a8f37df88ff9f5ac51\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://eba5f63324748c7b8e0d4de7960159265c7134938b8c031caf144dc2a80ea63e\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmeVADLVrr9XL8ULuAC2zgw7dU56puiJPrnM9279C4Ntr5\"]}},\"version\":1}","metadata":{"compiler":{"version":"0.8.24+commit.e11b9ed9"},"language":"Solidity","output":{"abi":[{"inputs":[],"type":"error","name":"InvalidInitialization"},{"inputs":[],"type":"error","name":"NotInitializing"},{"inputs":[{"internalType":"uint64","name":"version","type":"uint64","indexed":false}],"type":"event","name":"Initialized","anonymous":false}],"devdoc":{"kind":"dev","methods":{},"version":1},"userdoc":{"kind":"user","methods":{},"version":1}},"settings":{"remappings":["@openzeppelin-upgradeable/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/","@openzeppelin/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/","erc4626-tests/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/lib/erc4626-tests/","forge-std/=lib/forge-std/src/","halmos-cheatcodes/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/lib/halmos-cheatcodes/src/","openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/","openzeppelin-contracts/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/"],"optimizer":{"enabled":true,"runs":200},"metadata":{"bytecodeHash":"ipfs"},"compilationTarget":{"flattened/StoreV2.sol":"Initializable"},"evmVersion":"cancun","libraries":{}},"sources":{"flattened/StoreV2.sol":{"keccak256":"0xeceb79370488cccbaec3668f4079362271f4c20d957e08a8f37df88ff9f5ac51","urls":["bzz-raw://eba5f63324748c7b8e0d4de7960159265c7134938b8c031caf144dc2a80ea63e","dweb:/ipfs/QmeVADLVrr9XL8ULuAC2zgw7dU56puiJPrnM9279C4Ntr5"],"license":"MIT"}},"version":1},"id":0}
