## How It Works

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Bootstrap** (One-time)
- Nano company funds Jobs contract with initial USDC
- This provides starting capital for user acquisition

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **User Acquisition**
```solidity
Jobs.payForJob(workerAddress)
```
- Nano calls this to pay workers 32 USDC
- Workers create and fund user wallets

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Album Purchase**
```solidity
Store.buyAlbums()
```
- Users (workers) call this with their 32 USDC
- Automatically purchases 3200 albums (at 0.01 USDC each)
- Revenue accumulates in Store contract

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Commission Claim**
```solidity
Store.claimReferralCommissions(jobsAddress, amount)
```
- Nano claims earned commissions from Store
- Directs them to Jobs contract
- Jobs contract now has funds for more workers

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Cycle Continues** ‚ôªÔ∏è
- Jobs funded ‚Üí Pay workers ‚Üí Users buy albums ‚Üí Claim commissions ‚Üí Jobs funded
- System becomes self-sustaining

## Key Points

- **32 USDC** = Standard amount throughout the system
- **Two Companies**: Nano (referral) and Store (sales) with legal agreement
- **Self-Sustaining**: After initial funding, commissions fund future operations
- **Simple Flow**: Just 3 main contract calls in the cycle

## Contract Methods

### Jobs Contract
- `payForJob(address worker)` - Pays 32 USDC to worker
- `receiveFunds(uint256 amount)` - Accepts commission funds

### Store Contract  
- `buyAlbums()` - Purchases albums with available USDC
- `claimReferralCommissions(address destination, uint256 amount)` - Nano claims commissions

## Roles

- **Nano**: Has `JOB_PAYER_ROLE` in Jobs, `COMMISSION_CLAIMER_ROLE` in Store
- **Store Admin**: Separate entity, manages Store contract
- **Users**: No special roles, just call `buyAlbums()`
