## How It Works

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Bootstrap** (One-time)
- Nano company funds Jobs contract with initial USDC
- This provides starting capital for user acquisition

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **User Acquisition**
```solidity
Jobs.payForJob(workerAddress)
```
- Nano calls this to pay workers 32 USDC
- Workers create and fund user wallets

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Album Purchase**
```solidity
Store.buyAlbums()
```
- Users (workers) call this with their 32 USDC
- Automatically purchases 3200 albums (at 0.01 USDC each)
- Revenue accumulates in Store contract

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Commission Claim**
```solidity
Store.claimReferralCommissions(jobsAddress, amount)
```
- Nano claims earned commissions from Store
- Directs them to Jobs contract
- Jobs contract now has funds for more workers

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Cycle Continues** ‚ôªÔ∏è

The circular flow:
1. Nano LLC pays worker from Jobs contract (32 USDC)
2. Worker buys albums from Store (32 USDC)
3. Nano LLC claims commission from Store (32 USDC)
4. Commission goes back to Jobs contract
5. Jobs contract can now pay another worker
6. **Circle complete - cycle repeats!**

After initial funding, the system runs on commissions - no additional capital needed!

## Key Points

* 32 USDC = Standard amount throughout the system
* Two Companies: Nano (referral) and Store (sales) with legal agreement
* Self-Sustaining: After initial funding, commissions fund future operations
* Simple Flow: Just 3 main contract calls in the cycle

## Contract Methods

### Jobs Contract
* `payForJob(address worker)` - Pays 32 USDC to worker
* `receiveFunds(uint256 amount)` - Accepts commission funds

### Store Contract  
* `buyAlbums()` - Purchases albums with available USDC
* `claimReferralCommissions(address destination, uint256 amount)` - Nano claims commissions

## Roles

* Nano: Has `JOB_PAYER_ROLE` in Jobs, `COMMISSION_CLAIMER_ROLE` in Store
* Store Admin: Separate entity, manages Store contract
* Users: No special roles, just call `buyAlbums()`
